this is my first git related to android

an objective is to familiarise myself using git with Android projects  
... learn to use the "git integration" of Android Studio  
... see what files are not required/should not be "sent to the git"/made public

I'm not really interested about the "backup" aspect for now, more about organisation/collaboration preparation

an other objective is to increase my motivation to make this source code efficient, because when people can see my code, that motivates me to code, and to code better
And of course i hope this code will be useful to some people
___
This repo project is a "part" of a (closed source, commercial purpose) meeting/chat app i'm making

## This app part handles making the user enable location, and giving access to the precise location permission

I want to use "best"/modern solutions, except when they are not recommended, I use Kotlin and Compose
